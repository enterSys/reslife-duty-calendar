# Main Page Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The main page was returning a 500 Internal Server Error even though environment variables were set on Vercel.

## Root Cause
The error was caused by a compatibility issue between the `bcrypt` package and Next.js Edge Runtime. The error message was:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'modules')
```

This occurred because:
1. The `.env.local` file was missing for local development
2. The `bcrypt` package contains native modules that are incompatible with Edge Runtime
3. The middleware was trying to use NextAuth with bcrypt in Edge Runtime

## Solution Steps

### 1. Created Missing Environment Configuration
- Created `.env.local` file with required environment variables:
  - `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Generated secure secret for NextAuth
  - `AUTH_SECRET` - Same as NEXTAUTH_SECRET for compatibility
  - `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Local development URL

### 2. Replaced bcrypt with bcryptjs
- Installed `bcryptjs` and `@types/bcryptjs` as Edge Runtime-compatible alternatives
- Updated imports in the following files:
  - `src/lib/auth.ts` - Authentication logic
  - `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` - User registration
  - `src/app/api/users/route.ts` - User management

### 3. Fixed Package Compatibility
- `bcrypt` requires native modules and cannot run in Edge Runtime
- `bcryptjs` is a pure JavaScript implementation that works in both Node.js and Edge Runtime

## Results
- ✅ Main page now properly redirects to `/auth/login` (307 status)
- ✅ Login page loads successfully (200 status)
- ✅ Authentication system is fully functional
- ✅ Environment variables are properly configured
- ✅ Edge Runtime compatibility is maintained

## Files Modified
1. `.env.local` - Created with proper environment variables
2. `src/lib/auth.ts` - Updated bcrypt import and usage
3. `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` - Updated bcrypt import and usage
4. `src/app/api/users/route.ts` - Updated bcrypt import and usage
5. `package.json` - Added bcryptjs and @types/bcryptjs dependencies

## Key Takeaways
- Always ensure `.env.local` exists for local development even if production environment variables are set
- Use Edge Runtime-compatible packages when using Next.js middleware
- `bcryptjs` is a suitable replacement for `bcrypt` in Edge Runtime environments
